% This is a code to generate an adaptive but dense enough k-point mesh
% around CBM/VBM of a semiconductor. Generally this k-point is Gamma-point.
% 
% The non-self consistent calculation with this kpoint should be sufficient
% for the code, aMoBT and to obtain convergance and smoothness to some
% extent. Using a dense kpoint mesh is recommended.
